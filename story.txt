One day, an old clock said to a young clock: "You have to put 525,600 in a year."
The young clock  was frightened and said, "Wow, so much, how is this possible?! How can I accomplish so much!"
At this time, the other old clock smiled and said: "Don't be afraid, you only need to put it in one second, and you can stick to it every second."
young clock  was happy, thinking: It wouldn't be difficult to put it in a second. Try it. Sure enough, it was easy to put it.
Unconsciously, one year has passed, and young clock has already placed 525,600!
When we face great difficulties, we tend to be pacing. I donâ€™t know if we can set small goals in stages according to the actual situation, and we will do it one by one.

If we make small goals it is easier than trying to think about accomplishing the whole task at once. 
If we do little bits each day, it will be more rewarding to look at the results
in the short run, rather than focusing on what we still have to do.

In the long run, those small steps and small goals that you completed will add up and then you will have seen how far you have come

Therefore, persistence is the key to the real great accomplishments.
